INoDS (Inferring Network of infectious Disease Spread) 
================================================

This repository contains source code described in:


The primary purpose of INoDS is to assess whether an empirical contact network is likely to generate an observed pattern of infectious disease spread in a host population. INoDS also provides epidemiological insights into the spreading pathogen by estimating the per-contact rate of pathogen transmission.
